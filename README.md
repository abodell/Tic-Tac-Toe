# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in the browser.  This game supports playing between one human player against the unbeatable Minimax AI that I implemented.  

The human player will always go first, and they will always use the X marker.  Click on any of the squares once loading the website, and your marker will be placed.

If you want to play against the AI multiple times, use the restart button after completing a game.  This will clear the board and reset the turns, so the human player will once again be making the first move.
